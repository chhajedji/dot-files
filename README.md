Contains various configuration files for UNIX and Linux platoform.

Most configurations will work similarly for both platforms, but still few settings might be slightly different.
I use UNIX for my work and Linux at home, so many UNIX related configurations are work specific. OS used are as follows -

Mac : Mac OS X (10.14.5 and above)

Linux : Kubuntu (18.04 and above) and Arch
